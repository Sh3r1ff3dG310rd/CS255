The files included in this repository are the business requirement documents from project one and the system design document from project two of this course.  
Driver’s pass is a program that has students log in to online drivers training courses which has them complete the coursework, 
complete an exam, and then schedule an appointment for an actual driver's test.  
I thought that I did the diagrams portion of the assignments particularly well, one way I could improve is get a little bit more familiar with lucid chart.  
If I could revise one thing in these documents, it would probably be to go into the software development life cycle a little bit more in detail.  
When interpreting the users’ needs, I chose to come at it from a software security perspective and that's what I emphasized a lot when implementing my design.  
This course has brought to light the fact that in order to design a program you must do it through a structural mindset, and implementing these designs can definitely make that an achievable goal.
